				<li>Personal background: I am from Moldova. I am an international student and am excited to study at CPCC.</li>
				<li>Professional background: I worked as a software engineer back in Moldova for a few years. I mostly used C# for writing code.</li>
				<li>Academic background: I finished my Masters Degree in Software Development in Moldova. I am currently pursuing a Full Stack Programming degree.</li>
				<li>Background in this subject: I worked with web pages a little, more on the level of “Hello World” and explored new technologies when opportunities arise.</li>
				<li>Primary computer platform: Windows 10</li>
				<li>Courses I’m taking:
					<ul>
						<li>CTS-240 Project Management - required class - It is important to know how to properly manage projects.</li>
						<li>DBA-120 Database Programming - required class - I think almost everything uses some sort of database when it comes to storing information.</li>
						<li><a href="contract.html">WEB-115 Web Markup and Scripting</a> - required class - I suspect that everything and everyone has a web page now or you can get one for free, so it is good to know how it is working to build web pages yourself.</li>
						<li>WEB-140 Web Development Tools - required class - Important class in modern times.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Interesting item to remember me by: I liked to go from my university back home on foot during nice weather, it took around 2 hours.</li>
				<li>I’d also like to share: I like hiking and bicycle riding.</li>
