<h2>Course Contract</h2>
<p>I, <a href="?p=introduction.php">Alexei Simchiv-Mattson</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Spring 2023 WEB250 Database Driven Websites with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
<p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
<p>I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as an absences.</p>
